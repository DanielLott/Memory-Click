# Memory-Click-Game "Ohana"
week 19 react homework

---
## This Web-App game is a memory game in which the user/player must click(or tap) only once on each picture in a collection of pictures on cards. With each selection, one point is added to the score, which is kept current at the top of the page. The difficulty arises when, after each selection, the entire collection is shuffled randomly. If the user selects the same picture twice, the game is reset and the points go back to zero. Then the user must select all the pictures once again in order to achieve the maximum score, which is the same as the total amount of pictures. The maximum score is also kept at the top of the page and that total persists despite games won or lost. If you page is refreshed, both scores return to zero.

## This implementation has a family theme. The title, "Ohana" was borrowed from the Disney movie, _Lilo and Stitch_.

## It is formatted to work well on large monitors and also down to small, mobile screens.

## Technologies used:
* React, via create-react-app
* GitHub pages, for deployment
